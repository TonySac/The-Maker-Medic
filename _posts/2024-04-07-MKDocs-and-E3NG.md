We'll I'd say I've got about 90% of my Ender 3 NG parts printed and plan to build this week. With any luck I will have a least a printer with an active motion system before Friday. I still need to tear down the Ender 3 and probably grab a few tools. I've also been working on a [log page](https://e3nglog.themakermedic.com) in my spare time.

I got a little side tracked this past week after experimenting with MKDocs. I still have not 100% settled on a format for my blog/documentation. I thought Material for MKDocs looked promising so I started the transition. It just did not work out how I was hoping so we are stuck here for now.
