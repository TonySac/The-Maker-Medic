I haven't been too active here recently. The usual excuse of life got in the way. Regardless, I've still been working on some other projects, just not the greatest at documenting anything. Hopefully, I can circle back to this blog and my documentation and keep things a little more up to date.

On the 3D printing side, I parted out my Ender 3 NG build and depreciated the documentation. It was a hard decision as I spent so much time on the build an documentation. I'll be keeping my documents live as long as possible for reference to others. I had no issues with the printer, in fact when it worked, it worked great, even when it was still an Ender 3. I've used the analogy that my Ender was like a project car. Once it was working, everything was fine. But like any project car, or in this case printer, there was always something else that could be done or improved which of course resulted in downtime followed by some frustration until it was running again. Naturally, this cycle repeated itself. This lead me down the dark path of Bambu Labs and I am now the proud owner of an A1 Mini. The thing is a workhorse and had allowed me to launch a small Etsy shop and 3D printing/design business. I still have my Voron 0.2 for small ABS projects or when that urge to tinker hits.

My Home Lab setup has been pretty rock solid so far. Thats the good news. The bad news is I've stalled on the documentation. The worse news is since its been so solid, I'm about to screw it all up. I've started "real" NAS build that I hope to document. Following that, the plan is to nuke my current Home Lab setup and start over again. We'll see how that goes...

In the meantime, here's a link to my [Etsy shop](https://makermedicmfg.etsy.com) and my business website [Maker Medic Manufacturing](https://www.makermedicmfg.com).
