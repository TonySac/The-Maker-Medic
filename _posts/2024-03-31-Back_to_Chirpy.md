New projects are in the works. Let's start with the first one... continuing to revamp this page. I decided to return to the [Chripy](https://chirpy.cotes.page) theme after using [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Now that I have a bit more understanding of Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I think this format makes more sense. I still am working through presentation and all I really know is I'm trying to share some of my projects and keep my notes in a publicly accessible format. 

On that note, I started building, or converting rather, my Ender 3 Neo into the Ender 3 NG. I've designed a [documentation page](https://ender3ng.themakermedic.com) to go along with that project. Hopefully I can complete that project and document. Soon some information on home automation will follow.
